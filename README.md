MAQR: A Multi-agent based Routing Protocol in Mobile Robot Network
================================

## Source Code
All source code of MAQR is in src/maqr.

## Note
1) Integrated PARRoT and a single Q-learning based routing protocol in src/parrot and src/saqr.
2) Integrated a performance analyzer in src/stats.
3) The test scratch is in scratch/maqr-onoff.cc and scratch/multi-run.
4) I provide the whole ns-3 dev code here to avoid compatibility error. Still, you may only copy src/maqr into your ns3 src code.
